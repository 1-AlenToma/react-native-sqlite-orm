# react-native-sqlite-orm
 This is an ORM, build around `sqlite`. It will make operation like `UPDATE`, `SELECT` AND `INSERT` a lot easier to handle
 
 ## Installations

First install the desire sqlite database such as `react-native-sqlite-storage`.
note that the library do not depends on which type of database you are using eg you could also use `expo-sqlite`

```sh
npm install --save react-native-sqlite-storage
```

```sh
 npm react-native-sqlite-orm
```
Installation for `react-native-sqlite-storage` read [react-native-sqlite-storage](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-native-sqlite-storage)
